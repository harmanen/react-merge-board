# React merge board

Proof of concept demo for the board of merge-type games.

Developed using Node.js version 20.22.1 on Windows 11.

Run locally using `npm run dev`.

## Version history

- **0.1: First iteration of the dynamic grid generation and draggable objects**
  - Items can be moved around but that's pretty much it
  - Zero effort for the visuals at this point so looks horrible (but works!)
