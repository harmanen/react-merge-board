## Development

Developed using Node.js version 20.22.1 on Windows 11.

Run locally using `npm run dev`.

## Version history

- **0.3: Enhanced icons**
  - Display item tier numbers and define colours for tiers. Display colours in various places

- **0.2: Icons**
  - Define icons and colours for items

- **0.1: First iteration of the dynamic grid generation and draggable objects**
  - Items can be moved around but that's pretty much it
  - Zero effort for the visuals at this point so looks horrible (but works!)
